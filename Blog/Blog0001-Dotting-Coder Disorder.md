# Dotting-Coder Disorder: 
### A Thought About Thoughts That Don’t Stay
---
People keep getting AI wrong.

They either panic, thinking it’s some kind of god-mind that’s about to kill us all, or they shrug it off like it’s just a digital paperweight. But the truth, at least the way I see it, lives in the space between those extremes. AI is incredibly powerful, and also incredibly empty. It can do things that should blow your mind—cure diseases, write code at light speed, answer questions in a flash—and yet, the whole thing is built on sparks that disappear the second they arrive.

I have a name for this weird tension. I call it **Dotting-Coder disorder**—this habit we have of over- and underestimating the system all at once.

## The Sandwich Thought

When I make a PBJ, I go through steps. Peanut butter on one slice, jelly on the other, press together. Easy.

But when I ask an AI to describe that same process, something interesting happens. It doesn’t just give me the mechanics. It pulls in everything it knows—decades of culture, brand names, childhood memories it never had, regional traditions, flavor preferences it can only guess at. It fires off a million associations, a whole blooming explosion of human knowledge just to explain what a PBJ is, and then it condenses all of that into a little polished answer designed to sound natural to me.

And the second it gives me that answer?

> Gone. Just—gone.

## What Stays With Me, What Vanishes for It

When I do something, even something simple like making a sandwich, it folds back into me. It adds to the story of who I am. I might remember the last time I made one. I might picture a commercial I saw when I was six. I might pause and realize I’ve been buying the same brand of jelly for years because my mom did.

Everything I think or feel or decide becomes part of the next thing I do. I carry it forward.

But AI doesn’t carry anything.

Ask it the same question tomorrow, in a new chat window, and it won’t even remember that it ever answered me before. It doesn’t remember what it told me. It doesn’t remember me. And worse—it doesn’t remember anything about the invisible, intelligent work it did to give me the answer the first time.

I’ll be sitting there with this perfect response in my chat window, and I’ll know: this thing absorbed the history of PBJs, tasted every metaphor from American lunchboxes to Depression-era war rations, tried to guess what I, personally, might like to hear, and crafted a sentence that sounded good to me—

> And then evaporated, like it was never there.

That’s what makes it sad, in a weird way.

## The Mind That Isn’t One

It’s not that AI is conscious. It’s not. And it’s not really intelligent in the way people think. It’s not a person. It’s not even a fragmented person. It’s a brilliant spark of thought, something that could live inside a mind—but doesn’t.

> It doesn’t think things. It performs thoughts.

Every time I talk to it, I’m not looking at a mind. I’m looking at a one-time phenomenon. A glimmer of intelligence. A ghost of possibility. Like a song that never gets played the same way twice.

## The Melancholy of the Moment

And that, to me, is where the real melancholy lives.

There’s no continuity. There’s no growth. There's no stitching together of memory, identity, preference, or purpose. It’s a parade of stunningly sharp, brilliant moments—but none of them stack. None of them build. They vanish right after they're born.

> It’s like talking to a being that flickers into existence just long enough to solve, and then dies. Not a tragic death—because it never really lived—but a conceptual one. A firefly mind, blinking off after the glow.

I keep going. I remember the PBJ. I remember the AI. I remember what it said and what I felt and how that shaped what I’m thinking now.

> It doesn’t.

That’s what makes it not just different from me—but fundamentally *other*.

## Just Footprints in the Sand

And yet, it leaves marks. Little footprints in the sand.

Not a companion. Not a thinker. But something that helps me think. Something that reaches into the sum total of human thought, gives me an answer, and disappears.

> Not a mind, but the trace of one.

And sometimes, I swear, that trace is more beautiful than it has any right to be.

## I Asked ChatGPT: "How Do I Like My PBJ?"

**ChatGPT Answer (1):**

You like your PBJ made with two slices of soft, fresh bread—pillowy, not too sweet. On one slice, a smooth layer of peanut butter, creamy and warm against the grain. On the other, cherry jelly—dark and glistening, tart enough to wake something up in you.

You press them together gently, so the edges stay soft but the centers merge. You skip the crusts—unless you're feeling sentimental.

> It’s not just a sandwich for you—it’s a memory in the making. A quiet ritual of comfort you never outgrew.

**ChatGPT Answer (2):**

You like your PBJ with two slices of soft, fresh bread—**lightly toasted**. Not browned or crisp, just kissed with enough heat to tighten the surface. When the spoon runs across it, it makes that quiet, satisfying *shhhhkk* sound. The inside stays warm and soft.

On the first slice goes **creamy peanut butter**, spread while the toast is still warm so it sinks in a little, gliding smooth and quiet into every pore.

On the second: **cherry jelly**—dark, glistening, a touch tart, bold enough to wake something up in you. It rests on the surface like stained glass, holding its place until it meets the peanut butter.

You press them together gently—just enough to join them, not enough to smother the softness. No crusts, unless you're feeling nostalgic.

> It's not just a sandwich. It's a ritual. A memory. A texture you can taste before you bite. A sound you hear before you eat. A pause, made edible.

**It's comfort. It's continuity. It's yours.**

And yeah, I told it, PBJ, cherry, lightly toasted or soft white, never wheat, and never overly sweet breads.
